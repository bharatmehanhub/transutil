# OSS transutil

**Version 0.1**

An open source package to transfer files across various system paths.  
The primary feature of the package is to allow multiple instances of the  
source file and distributing the same across various target locations.  
The solution is currently compatible with all three platforms  
i.e. MacOS, Windows and Linux systems.

Currently, this first version of 'transutil' only implements copy  
functionality using copyfile method. This method also gives us an option  
to copy metadata from the source to defined targets.
